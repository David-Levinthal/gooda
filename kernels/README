The build scripts were written for redhat..
if running on ubuntu change the first line of the build.sh from
#! /bin/sh
to
#! /bin/bash

the machine should be set up with perf which requires the following instructions be executed as root (not sudo)
          su root
          echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
          echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
as sudo
sudo modprobe msr

further prefetchers should be disabled in the bios for most tests, though the bandwidth tests should be run with and without hw prefetchers.
and numa_balancing needs to be disabled
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
and for TLB testing it is a good idea to disable THP
echo never | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
